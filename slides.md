# Conditionals

- in JSX, with the curly braces, we can't use JS statements, only expressions
  - why do you think we can't use JS statements?  (think what is being passed to `React.createElement()`? )
- use of `&&` 
  - ex: `{ isOnline && <div className="green" /> }`
  - why does the above work?  what's happening?
  - ex: `{ numOfItems > 0 && <ShoppingList items={shoppingList} /> }`
  - ex: `{ !!numOfItems && <ShoppingList items={shoppingList} /> }`
- use of ternary operators
  ```jsx
  return (
    <>
      { isLoggedIn ? <AdminDashboard /> : <p>Please login first</p> }
    </>
  )
  ```

# Exercise: Use conditional for a prop
5 mins. Continuing with your first iteration of this component from an earlier slide...

- Modify your `<Button />` component such that if it is given the `disabled` prop, it will actually make the button disabled
   - reminder: can disable an HTML button tag via `<button disabled>Submit</button>`
`<Button label="Submit" disabled />`

# Exercise: Use conditional for text
5 mins. Continuing with your first iteration of this component from an earlier slide...

<img src="/assets/inbox.png" style="width: 400px" />

- make it so that if variable `isFollowing` is true, then the button text will say `- Following`
   - otherwise if `isFollowing`is false, then button text will say `+ Follow`
